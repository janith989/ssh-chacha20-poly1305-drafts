<abstract>
<t>This document describes the <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> authenticated encryption
cipher for use in SSH based on AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 described in
<xref target="RFC7539"/>.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t><spanx style="verb">AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305</spanx> from <xref target="RFC7539"/> is an &quot;Authenticated
Encryption with Associated Data&quot; (AEAD) cipher.  It takes a 256-bit key
and a 96-bit nonce, and is based on the ChaCha20 and Poly1305 primitives
both designed by Daniel Bernstein.
</t>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="negotiation" title="Negotiation">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> encryption algorithm offers both encryption and
authentication.  As such, no separate MAC is required.  If the
<spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> algorithm is selected in key exchange, the offered
MAC algorithms MUST be ignored and no MAC is required to be present.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="detailed-construction" title="Detailed Construction">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> cipher requires 256 bits (32 bytes) of key
material as output from the SSH key exchange.
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> does not require any &quot;Initial IV&quot; or &quot;Integrity&quot; key
material.
</t>
<t>The nonce is constructed by appending the big-endian encoding of the
32-bit sequence number to 8 zero bytes.
</t>
<t>Section 2.6 in <xref target="RFC7539"/> describes how the Poly1305 key is generated
from the output of the first (counter = 0) ChaCha20 block for a given
packet.  The second half of this block (&quot;The other 256 bits&quot;) are
discarded usually.  The next 32 bits of those otherwise discarded 256
bits are used as <spanx style="verb">packet_length_encryption</spanx>.
</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> is encrypted by performing XOR of the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx>
with the <spanx style="verb">packet_length_encryption</spanx>.
</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> encryption algorithm also serves as the MAC
algorithm, and uses the 128-bit tag from Poly1305 as MAC.
</t>

<section anchor="additional-authenticated-data" title="Additional Authenticated Data">
<t>The additional authenticated data (AAD) consists of the encrypted packet
length.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="packet-handling" title="Packet Handling">

<section anchor="padding" title="Padding">
<t>With AEAD algorithms the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field is usually not encrypted
using the normal AEAD algorithm, as it needs to be decrypted without
knowing how long the packet is going to be.
</t>
<t>While the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> can be encrypted in a different way, the
packet content must be padded without the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field to a
multiple of the block size.
</t>
<t>As <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> is a stream cipher and has no block size
requirements the minimum SSH alignment requirement of 8 bytes is used
instead (see section 6 of <xref target="RFC4253"/>).
</t>
<t>The minimum size of a packet (including the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field but
not the mac) is 12 bytes (instead of the 16 bytes): the content is
padded to at least 8 bytes plus 4 bytes for the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="receiving-packets" title="Receiving packets">
<t>When receiving a packet the length must be decrypted first.  When 4
bytes of ciphertext length have been received, they need to be decrypted
by applying XOR with the <spanx style="verb">packet_length_encryption</spanx> key for this packet.
</t>
<t>The receiver SHOULD verify the packet length (minimum length is 8 bytes,
must be a multiple of 8 and must not exceed maximum expected packet
length).
</t>
<t>Once the entire packet content of further <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> bytes and the
mac has been received, the packet is decrypted as described in
<xref target="RFC7539"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sending-packets" title="Sending packets">
<t>To send a packet the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> is encrypted by applying XOR with
the <spanx style="verb">packet_length_encryption</spanx> key for this packet.  Then the packet
content is encrypted as described in <xref target="RFC7539"/> and the Poly1305 tag is
appended as <spanx style="verb">mac</spanx>.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="rekeying" title="Rekeying">
<t><spanx style="verb">AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305</spanx> must never reuse a {key, nonce} combination for
encryption.  The nonce wraps around every 2^32 packets, and therefore
the same key MUST NOT be used for more than 2^32 packets.  The SSH
Transport protocol <xref target="RFC4253"/> recommends a far more conservative
rekeying every 1GB of data sent or received.  If this recommendation is
followed, then <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx> requires no special handling in this
area.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="differences-to-rfc-7539" title="Differences to RFC 7539">
<t>In section 2.3 of <xref target="RFC7539"/> a different ChaCha20 construction is
described; it uses a 12-byte nonce and a 4-byte counter.  By removing
the last 4 bytes of the 8-byte counter (which are always zero in ssh)
and prefixing 4 zero bytes to the 8-byte nonce one can get a <xref target="RFC7539"/>
compatible representation as 4-byte counter and 12-byte nonce.
</t>
<t>The data Poly1305 is applied to in section 2.8 of <xref target="RFC7539"/> differs
too: it adds padding and encodes the length of ciphertext and AAD.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security considerations">
<t>An attacker can flip single bits in the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field by
flipping them in the encrypted data.  This is also true for other
encryption algorithms like &quot;<spanx style="verb">*-ctr</spanx>&quot; from <xref target="RFC4344"/> based on XOR.
</t>
<t>For further details on the Chacha20 and Poly1305 combination see section
4 of <xref target="RFC7539"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA considerations">
<t>Consistent with Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC4250"/>, this document registers the
name &quot;<spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305</spanx>&quot; in the Encryption Algorithm Names registry
for the encryption algorithm defined in this document.
