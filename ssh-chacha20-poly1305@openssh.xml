<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>ChaCha20 is a stream cipher designed by Daniel Bernstein and described
in <xref target="ChaCha"/>.  It operates by permuting 128 fixed bits, 128 or 256 bits
of key, a 64 bit nonce and a 64 bit counter into 64 bytes of output.
This output is used as a keystream, with any unused bytes simply
discarded.
</t>
<t>Poly1305 <xref target="Poly1305"/>, also by Daniel Bernstein, is a one-time
Carter-Wegman MAC that computes a 128 bit integrity tag given a message
and a single-use 256 bit secret key.
</t>
<t>The &quot;<spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx>&quot; cipher combines these two
primitives into an authenticated encryption mode.  The construction used
is based on that used with TLS  in <xref target="RFC7539"/>, but differs in the
layout of data passed to the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and in
the addition of encyption of the packet lengths.
</t>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
&quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="negotiation" title="Negotiation">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> offers both encryption and
authentication.  As such, no separate MAC is required.  If the
<spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> cipher is selected in key exchange, the
offered MAC algorithms MUST be ignored and no common MAC is required to
be present.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="detailed-construction" title="Detailed Construction">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> cipher requires 512 bits of key
material as output from the SSH key exchange.  This forms two 256 bit
keys (<spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">K_header</spanx>), used by two separate instances of
ChaCha20.
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> does not require any &quot;Initial IV&quot; or
&quot;Integrity&quot; key material.
</t>
<t>ChaCha20 requires a 8-byte nonce and a 8-byte counter.  The nonce is
constructed by encoding the packet sequence number (a 32-bit value, see
section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC4253"/>) as uint64 under the SSH wire encoding rules
given in section 5 of <xref target="RFC4251"/>.  The counter is initialized with zero
unless otherwise noted and is stored in little-endian order.
</t>
<t>The instance keyed by <spanx style="verb">K_header</spanx> is a stream cipher that is used only to
encrypt the 4 byte packet length field.  The second instance, keyed by
<spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx>, is used in conjunction with Poly1305 to build an Authenticated
Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) that is used to encrypt and
authenticate the entire packet.
</t>
<t>The AEAD is constructed as follows: for each packet, generate a Poly1305
key by taking the first 256 bits of ChaCha20 stream output generated
using <spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx>.  The next 256 bits of the ChaCha20 stream output are
discarded, i.e. the <spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx> ChaCha20 block counter is then set to the
little-endian encoding of 1 (i.e. {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) and this
instance is used for encryption of the packet payload.
</t>
<t>The additional authenticated data (AAD) consists of the ciphertext of
the packet length and is always 4 bytes long.
</t>
<t>The Poly1305 MAC is calculated over the concatentation of the AAD and
the ciphertext of the packet, i.e. the whole packet apart from the MAC.
The Poly1305 <spanx style="verb">mac_length</spanx> is 16 bytes.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="packet-handling" title="Packet Handling">

<section anchor="padding" title="Padding">
<t>In openssh Encrypt Then Mac (ETM) MAC algorithms pad the packet without
the packet length field; <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> is an ETM
algorithm in this sense.
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> is a stream cipher and has no block size
requirements; SSH therefore requires an 8-byte alignment (see section 6
of <xref target="RFC4253"/>).
</t>
<t>The minimum size of a packet (including the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field but
not the mac) is 12 bytes: the content is padded to at least 8 bytes plus
4 bytes for the <spanx style="verb">packet_length</spanx> field.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="receiving-packets" title="Receiving packets">
<t>When receiving a packet, the length must be decrypted first.  When 4
bytes of ciphertext length have been received, they may be decrypted
using the <spanx style="verb">K_header</spanx> key.
</t>
<t>Once the entire packet has been received, the MAC MUST be checked before
decryption.  A per-packet Poly1305 key is generated as described above
and the MAC tag calculated using Poly1305 with this key over the
ciphertext of the packet length and the payload together.  The
calculated MAC is then compared in constant time with the one appended
to the packet.
</t>
<t>If the calculated MAC does not match the one appended to the packet
decryption must fail.  The packet MUST NOT be completely or partially
decrypted before the MAC was checked.
</t>
<t>If the MAC was checked successfully the packet is decrypted using
ChaCha20 as described above (with <spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx> and a starting block counter
of 1).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sending-packets" title="Sending packets">
<t>To send a packet, first encode the 4 byte length and encrypt it using
<spanx style="verb">K_header</spanx>.  Encrypt the packet payload (using <spanx style="verb">K_main</spanx>) and append it
to the encrypted length.  Finally, calculate a MAC tag and append it.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="rekeying" title="Rekeying">
<t>ChaCha20 must never reuse a {key, nonce} for encryption nor may it be
used to encrypt more than 2^70 bytes under the same {key, nonce}.  The
SSH Transport protocol <xref target="RFC4253"/> recommends a far more conservative
rekeying every 1GB of data sent or received.  If this recommendation is
followed, then <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> requires no special
handling in this area.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="differences-to-rfc-7539" title="Differences to RFC 7539">
<t>Chacha20 as described in <xref target="RFC7539"/> differs from [ChaCha] in the size of
the counter and the nonce. Both algorithms concatenate counter and nonce
to form a 16-byte input for the ChaCha20 function, but <xref target="RFC7539"/> uses a
4-byte counter and a 12-byte nonce, and [ChaCha] uses a 8-byte counter
and a 8-byte nonce.
</t>
<t>The counter is a little endian integer which never reaches 2^32^ in the
SSH protocol, and the nonce is the big endian encoding of the 32-bit
sequence number. Therefore no matter which Chacha specification is
chosen the input looks like this:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
&lt;little endian 32-bit counter&gt; || 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 || &lt;big endian 32-bit sequence number&gt;
</artwork></figure>
<t>The data Poly1305 is applied to in section 2.8 of <xref target="RFC7539"/> differs
too: <xref target="RFC7539"/> adds padding and encodes the length of ciphertext and
AAD.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security considerations">
<t>Two separate cipher instances are used here so as to keep the packet
lengths confidential but not create an oracle for the packet payload
cipher by decrypting and using the packet length prior to checking the
MAC.  By using an independently-keyed cipher instance to encrypt the
length, an active attacker seeking to exploit the packet input handling
as a decryption oracle can learn nothing about the payload contents or
its MAC (assuming key derivation, ChaCha20 and Poly1305 are secure).
</t>
<t>As the MAC needs to be checked before decrypting the packet, packet
sizes must be limited to what an implementation can buffer.
</t>
<t>Although the Poly1305 construction is different from <xref target="RFC7539"/> it
should offer comparable security.  The length of the AAD doesn't need to
be encoded as it has a fixed length of 4 bytes, and the length of the
encrypted content doesn't need to be encoded either as Poly1305 appends
a 0x01 byte to each block, leading to a fixed termination of a
potentially partial last block.
</t>
<t>For further details on the Chacha20 and Poly1305 combination see section
4 of <xref target="RFC7539"/>.

<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA considerations">
<t>As the name <spanx style="verb">chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com</spanx> is a local extension it
cannot be registered by the IANA according to section 4.6.1 of
